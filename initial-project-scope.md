Step-by-Step Plan
1. Improve the Web Scraper

Enhance Data Extraction: Extract key business details such as:
- Business name
- Logo
- Address
- Phone number
- Services offered
- Business hours
- Images
- Meta descriptions and keywords (for SEO)

Store Data in JSON: Instead of Markdown, save extracted data in a structured JSON format.

Support Multiple URLs: Modify the script to accept a list of business URLs and scrape them in batches.

Integrate Google Maps API (Future Feature):
- Use the API to search for businesses by location and category.
- Extract their website URLs to automate the scraping process.

2. Create Website Templates

Technology Stack Options:
- Static Sites: Use Next.js or Astro for fast, simple pages.
- CMS-Driven: WordPress or Webflow (good if clients want to edit their sites).
- Headless CMS: Strapi or Sanity if you want to keep the backend flexible.

Hosting Suggestions:
- Vercel (for Next.js, free tier available)
- Netlify (for static sites, free tier available)
- Firebase Hosting (good if you plan to add AI features later)
- DigitalOcean/Cloudflare Pages (scalable and fast)

Template Design:
- Create a few different business-focused templates (plumber, salon, lawyer, etc.).
- Ensure they support dynamic data input.

3. Programmatically Insert Extracted Data

Develop a Data Mapping System:
- Use a templating engine (e.g., Handlebars, EJS) to inject JSON data into HTML templates.
Example:
const template = fs.readFileSync('template.html', 'utf8');
const compiled = Handlebars.compile(template);
const filledTemplate = compiled(businessData);

Automate the Website Generation:
- Create a script that:
- Reads the JSON data.
- Fills a website template with extracted data.
- Deploys the generated site to Vercel/Netlify automatically.

4. Send the Business Their New Website

Generate a Preview Link: Host each example website on a subdomain (e.g., plumber-demo.yoursite.com).
Email Outreach:
- Send businesses an email with their new website link.
- Highlight improvements (better design, SEO, mobile-friendly, etc.).
- Offer free trial hosting.

5. Upsell AI Features

- AI Chatbot/Call Bot:
- Use OpenAIâ€™s API or a service like Twilio for an AI-powered call bot.
- Example: Allow businesses to automate customer inquiries via an AI receptionist.
- Lead Generation AI:
- Use AI to analyze incoming messages and categorize leads.

SEO & Content Generation:
- AI-generated blog posts to improve their website ranking.

Next Steps
- Update the Scraper: Extract more structured data and save it as JSON.
- Build Website Templates: Choose a hosting solution and create business-oriented templates.
- Automate Data Insertion: Use a templating engine to generate websites dynamically.
- Deploy & Test: Generate example sites and test deployment to Vercel/Netlify.
- Set Up Business Outreach: Plan a strategy to send businesses their improved websites.
