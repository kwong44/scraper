# Project Guidelines

## Tech Stack
- Node.js
- Playwright
- Google Maps API
- Handlebars
- Next.js
- Vercel / Netlify

## Code Style and Structure
- Write modular, reusable Node.js code with clear separation of concerns.

- Programmatically inject extracted data into templates before hosting.
- Deploy on Vercel or Netlify with automated deployment scripts.

## Performance Optimization
- Optimize Playwright settings to reduce load time and unnecessary resource usage.
- Ensure SEO-friendly markup and lightweight assets for fast load times.

## Future Features
